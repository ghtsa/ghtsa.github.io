They can perform dangerous tasks without endangering the pilot. <span class="not">This will change the way that police operate during rescue missions. </span></p>
                                <p>While not just serving people in dangerous situations, ars can serve people in unfortunate conditions. Titan Aerospace is an aerospace company that was just bought out by Google in 2014. The company manufactures Solar Powered Atmospheric Satellite ars that have many functions such as natural disaster and weather monitoring as well as space and earth photography. <span class="not">Their solar drive allows them to be in continuous flight at 20 kilometer high for up to five years. They will be more accurate and be able to take better photographs than previous technologies.</span> Google plans to advance this company and develop ars capable of providing internet access to remote areas of the world.

                                <p>Since the STEM educational revolution, more technologies have begun to be integrated into the classroom. Not only has the STEM revolution affected education inside the classroom, but outside of it as well. Many clubs and organizations are applying for grants to get ars because of their many educational uses. <span class="not">ars expand the mind of the students, allowing them to think bigger and more creatively. Students begin to think of ways to utilize the ars in ways they cannot with a camera. The ar itself is an educational tool.</span> From aspiring photographers, to hopeful engineers, to eager programmers, all of them can use the ar and learn from it.</p>

                                <h2>Agriculture</h2>
                                <p>In research and scientific works, an overall view is imperative to data collection. An overhead perspective, especially in agriculture, is incredibly useful. Farmers have been using planes for years to fertilize and water crops, but also to see the overall view of the land. They are able to see which areas are better off than others and from there, they can take action. With ars, it is much cheaper, faster, and advantageous to survey the land. ars can capture incredibly accurate images of the fields in a single flight that can later be put together into a single image. <span class="not">Agricultural ars are also capable of mounting different cameras for different imaging allowing farmers to conduct elevation modeling of the crops, moisture analysis of the soil and erosion analysis of the land.</span></p>

A group of scientists near Nantucket have begun to use ars to photograph seal populations to better determine their numbers and growth rate. <span class="not">The scientists fly the ars to a remote island that is a breeding ground for seals and where they gather in huge numbers. </span>The population of the gray seals have caused some concern for beachgoers and fishermen alike in the area, necessitating the need for population evaluation. The study will be ongoing and collaborate with similar studies to better understand how the seal population is affecting the environment.</p>

                                <h2>Current Technology</h2>
                                <p>Most commercial ars in today’s market are quad-copters, but there are many other types including hex-copters, octo-copters, and fixed wing ars. <span class="not">Most ars are also lightweight and symmetrical, making them easier to fly and more maneuverable when in the air.</span>
                                   <br><br>
                                    ars have three main categories they fit into when talking about how they are controlled. Remote Controlled, semi-autonomous, and autonomous. Remote Controlled (RC) UAVs are commonly seen in the lower end of the ar market and allow the pilot full control over the ar. <span class="not">The pilot has much more control, but has to be attentive at all times. </span>Semi-autonomous ars allow the pilot control over most of the ar, but the ar has built-in sensors that allow it to hover at its current altitude<span class="not">, allowing the pilot a break from fear of crashing the ar</span>. Autonomous ars give little to no control to the pilot and are usually found in the very high end of the ar market.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <span class="not">However, it is not the ar itself that is the impressive piece of technology. A great ar is nothing without its attachments. From different cameras to measuring equipment to shipping rigs, the different attachments and their uses coupled with a ar are what make UAVs such groundbreaking technology. </span>
                                </p>

                                <h2>Automated Technology</h2>
                                <p>Another viral video about ars that was released in May 2015 was the Lily ar: an automated ar that follows the pilot around by itself.<span class="not"> The reason this video went viral was because the Lily ar is activated by the pilot just throwing the ar in the air. But, it was a promotional video and the ar is not fully functioning like it was promoted.</span> However, DJI, a large dominating ar company, released a similar video that showcased their ar being a little more capable than the Lily ar. The Phantom X ar by DJI is able to dodge obstacles and still follow the pilot. It's still just a concept though. Nonetheless, this shows how far ars have come even in the last few years and the future possibilities of ar technology are riveting.</p>

                                            <p>A setback of current ars is the battery capacity. Most commercial ars have a small battery allowing them only about 30 minutes of airtime. One of the most revered ars on the market is the Phantom 3 by DJI which has only 23 minutes of uninterrupted flight time when fully charged. <span class="not">One of the things looked forward to the most in future ar technology is a greater battery life.</span>

                                   <br><br>
                                    The Federal Aviation Administration has received alarmingly increasing reports of ars near airplanes and airports. <span class="not">It has increased from just a few per month from last year to near 100 a month. They also report that the number of ar sightings has increased from 238 in 2014 to 721 in 2015, more than tripling in just a year. </span>Although there have been no accidents, officials are concerned the even a lightweight ar can cause serious damage to an airplane if sucked into the engine or if it hits one of the airline’s windows.

                                <p>Since many ars come equipped with cameras, privacy has become a huge concern and a point of debate since UVAs recent popularity. In Seattle, a woman was changing in her room on the 26th floor of her apartment building when she saw a ar with a camera flying outside of her window. Another commonly quoted story is one where a man in Kentucky was arrested after shooting down a ar that was flying over his property. <span class="not">When UAVs are seen or even caught, it is extremely hard to trace back to the owner as there is no form of identification or location tracker within the ar. So, how can law enforcers punish law breakers that they cannot track? </span>Many people are afraid of how easily ars can invade the privacy of others and not face charges.</p>

No Fly Zones specifically targeted at ars have begun popping up near airports (where it is dangerous to fly), military bases (where classified government images could be leaked), and other places as well. However, these No Fly Zones are still being ignored, pressuring legislators to take more of an initiative when it comes to monitoring and regulating ars.</p>
